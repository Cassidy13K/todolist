- conditional for cursor in style sheet
- styling

FIX THIS

CALCULATOR

1 file for logic functions
don't initiate functions/ don't put them in a class (can't call function inside class)
call real numbers with key not .keycode


TO DO LIST

sorting: remove defaultchecked, have checked derived from state

also sort alphabetically (a, b => a.title > b.title)

make numberoffunction + totalnumber for unsorted

style fixes:
button font
make <ul> non-show-bulletpoints cuz using checkboxes
put cursor enabled into input file not style file and call it in-line
